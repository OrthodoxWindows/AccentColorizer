# AccentColorizer

Colorize Windows with accent color of your choice - without modifying system files

AccentColorizer patches Windows theme data in-memory and recolorizes everything as soon as you change the accent color

Use in combination with [ContextMenuNormalizer](https://github.com/krlvm/ContextMenuNormalizer) to make context menus look more consistent on Windows 10
